            <h2>The Brewery</h2>
            <h3>Conference and Events Centre</h3>
            <p>The Golang UK Conference is held at <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/">The Brewery</a> right in the heart of the City of London. The Brewery occupies the site of the former Whitbread brewery in East London. Samuel Whitbread opened The Brewery in 1750. Brewing on the site continued until 1976.</p>
            <p>The Brewery is a beautiful venue, with unique rooms and ambient lighting which provide the perfect creative atmosphere, encouraging networking and learning. There will be dedicated space for delegates to relax, charge their equipment and network with other attendees.</p>

            <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    	   <p>We have visited and inspected a number of hotels in the direct vicinity of the Brewery - we looked at rooms in each one and have selected three that we believe represent excellent value for conference accommodation. There are many other hotels in the area including, of course, <a href="http://www.themontcalm.com/hotel-the-montcalm-at-the-brewery-london-city-100.html" target-"_blank">the Montcalm</a> which is located in the conference centre.</p>
            <p>Other local hotels are shown on the Brewery site <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/Where-to-stay-nearby" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        	<p><em>Note: Delegates would be well advised to book accommodation as soon as possible as London hotels tend to fill up quickly.</em></p>
