            <h2>Level One Course - Hardcore Go: The Essentials</h2>
            <h3>Instructor: William Kennedy</h3>
            <p>This class is for the developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go's type system, concurrency, channels and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals.</p>
