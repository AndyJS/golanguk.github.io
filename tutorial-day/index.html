	    <p>Golang UK 2015 is proud to work with <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com" target="_blank">Ardan Labs</a> to bring to you a full day of Hardcore Go on Thursday, 20th August 2015, a day before the conference.</p>
	    <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
	    <p>This is a 1 day class for any level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go's type system, concurrency, channels and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals. We would love to have you attend this paid workshop.</p>
