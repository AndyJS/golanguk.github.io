            speaker: William Kennedy
            title: "Hardcore Go: The Essentials"
            description: |
              This class is for the developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go's type system, concurrency, channels and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals.<br><a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/golang-uk-conference-2016-tickets-21135268156">Buy tickets</a>

            description: |
              If you are a seasoned Go developer and have even worked on a project or two, then this class is for you. In the first part of the class you will take a deep dive into the io package of the standard library. Learn about all there is to know to effectively use the io package. In the second part of the class, we will show you as much of the Go tooling as we can to help you understand and debug your programs.<br><a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/golang-uk-conference-2016-tickets-21135268156">Buy tickets</a>
