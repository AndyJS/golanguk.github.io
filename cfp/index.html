<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col span12">
    	<h2>Closes May 31<sup>th</sup> 2015 Midnight GMT</h2>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The main attraction of any conference is the talks that are given and we aim to attract the best speakers from around the world. We solicit talks through a call for papers so you, the community, can tell us what kinds of things everyone should be hearing about.</p>

		<p>We are looking for talks relating to Go programming language, be it mainstream, advanced, niche or non-technical. We are looking for real 'wow' talks that are fresh and inspiring about cutting edge topics or new perspectives on common problems. The audience will be from all backgrounds varying in skill level from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so talks varying widely in topic and skill levels are required. Most of all we want speakers who have a deep knowledge about the topics they are proposing and can't wait to share that knowledge with a whole group of of eager listeners. Tell us what you're most passionate about and why we should be passionate about it as well.</p>

		<h2>Selection Process</h2>
		<p>It's the first edition of the conference so we don't know how many papers we're going to receive. We're going to select 12 talks (2 tracks + 2 keynotes), following 3 step process:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Using an anonymised list of all papers (contains talk title, abstract, and 'why you should choose this talk'), the organisers rate each talk from 1-5 to create a shortlist of around 60 abstracts.</li>
			<li>Abstracts are then discussed and put in order of must have talks, with the top 30-40 papers being the focus.</li>
			<li>Submissions are then deanonymised and final selections are made based on the speaker's location/cost of travel and level of the talk.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Package</h3>
		<p>What's in it for me? Fame and fortune! Well, maybe not just yet, but, speaking at a conference is a great way to give back to the amazing Go community that has given so much to you. In addition to giving back to the community, we are very pleased to be able to offer the following benefits package to all our speakers:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Entry to the conference and all the social events</li>
			<li>Travel expenses paid in full (if needed)</li>
			<li>Two nights accommodation (before and after the day of your talk &amp; in case that they are needed)</li>
			<li>Invitation to the complimentary speaker's dinner</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to Submit</h2>
		<p>Interested in giving a talk? Please complete the submission information laid out in a handy form for you. We'll need to know some bits and bobs about yourself and we'll need a title and abstract (up to 200 words) of the talk you'd like to give. We're also interested to know why you think we should choose your talk. You can submit as many talk proposals as you like!</p>
