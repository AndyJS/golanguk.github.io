                      Programming since age 6 (Mat would type BASIC code out from computer magazines with his father to make little programs and games), Mat has always had a keen obsession with programming. When Go came along, he loved the philosophy and the elegance of the language, and has been using it since before v1. In 2015 his first book Go Programming Blueprints was published. Last year he spoke about Building APIs at Golang UK and now he’s back this year to bang on about Go.
